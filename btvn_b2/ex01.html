    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>
      This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about cooking technique called
      <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food
      (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set
      to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
      <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as
      <q>ultra-low temperature poaching</q>.

      Next month, we will be serving
      <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat
      at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
